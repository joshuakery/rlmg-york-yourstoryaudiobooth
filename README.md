# York County History Center Your Story Audio Booth

This Unity project powers the Your Story Audio Booth exhibit at [York County History Center](https://www.yorkhistorycenter.org/) in York, PA, created with [Richard Lewis Media Group](https://www.rlmg.com/).

Visitors to this exhibit record their voice in response to a selection of prompts related to York County's history, edit their recordings, and optionally share them with the museum's archives.

This is a complete repository of the Unity project. Like all Unity projects, some or much additional work may be involved in getting this to run on a new machine.
